Description

A Python script to automate creation of supporting EtherCAT files 
including SSI EEPROM, EtherCATInfo XML (ESI file), and certain related 
source and header files for the Beckhoff slave stack code.

mesicat accepts a .mesi file (Meta ESI) containing a description of 
the EtherCAT CoE dictionary and other stack configuration information. 
Make commands in this file then trigger the creation of sane defaults, 
SII EEPROM, XML files, and so forth. The .mesi file is inspired by the 
various IDL files used in web space (e.g. protobuf) and uses a C-like 
syntax to reduce cognitive overhead when developing slave code.

The goal is to automate EtherCAT compliance to the extent practicable 
and provide a DRY (don't repeat yourself) automated build for the required 
files.
